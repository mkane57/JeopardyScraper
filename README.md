# JeopardyScraper
Console Application to scrape information from www.j-archive.com and produce a robust JSON file.

This application was written by a team of UC Berkeley students for a final project for a Data Visualization class in order 
to scrape the information from the J!Archive (http://www.j-archive.com) website that holds nearly every clue for every game
of Jeopardy ever played.  This code is open sourced and offered freely under the MIT license.  Enjoy!
